# OOP Fundamentals

Welcome to the **OOP Fundamentals** repository! This project is a collection of .NET projects that demonstrate various concepts and principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C#.

## About the Project

The goal of this repository is to serve as a learning resource for anyone interested in understanding and mastering the fundamentals of OOP. It includes examples and exercises that cover the key principles of OOP, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Features

- **Encapsulation**: Learn how to bundle data and methods that operate on the data within one unit, such as a class.
- **Inheritance**: Understand how to create a new class that reuses, extends, and modifies the behavior defined in another class.
- **Polymorphism**: Explore how to process objects differently based on their data type or class.
- **Abstraction**: Discover how to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details in your code.
